The dimensions is first set as a 5x5 for matrix D and vector u is of length 5
Values for u is random between 1 and 5
D's diagonalvalues is random between 1 and 5 however the max possible value for u^Tu (25n) times two is added to the next d_i such this is in compliance with d_n ≤ λ_n ≤ d_n + u^Tu (equation 25)(the factor two is there for extra seperation)

Next equation 23 in the chapter eigenvalues is calculated where the roots m of the equation is the (updated) eigenvalues 
The roots are found with the Newton-Raphson method and each guess will be d_i + u^Tu/2 
Since all values in u is above 0 there are 5 possible solutions which will be found with the uncertainty that f(λ) = 0 +- 1e-3
Found eigenvalue λ = 18.5161374168875 where f(λ) = 0.00098397789627506 at 88 itterations
Found eigenvalue λ = 253.023913500413 where f(λ) = 0.000630981949567228 at 32 itterations
Found eigenvalue λ = 504.965345283872 where f(λ) = 0.000585439945662328 at 30 itterations
Found eigenvalue λ = 770.164497458076 where f(λ) = 0.00096183635049411 at 90 itterations
Found eigenvalue λ = 1005.36580003068 where f(λ) = 0.000851208771509016 at 58 itterations
Here it can be noticed that some of the eigenvalues are indeed within d_n ≤ λ_n ≤ d_n + u^Tu. To make sure I test it for all eigenvalues and are all eigenvalues indeed in compliance with equation 25 ? True
The total number of found eigenvalues = 5 (should be equal to n which is 5 for this case)
Is all n eigenvalues different ? True

Next we will test the implication a bit more with a random generated n:[400;450], n = 436
Are all eigenvalues indeed in compliance with equation 25 ? True
The total number of found eigenvalues = 436
Is all n eigenvalues different ? True 

This then proves that the program finds all possible (updated) eigenvalues. 
Next task is to show that the operations scale with O(n²), this will be shown on the plot 'operations_pr_n.svg'.
The sum of all itterations to find all n (update) eigenvalues is divided with n² such the plot should be a straight line if the number of operations scales with n²
The plot is linear when the matrix is reasonably large and therefore I have found the eigenvalues of A using only O(n²) operations
